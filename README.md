# BRIGHTSPOT Movie Production - Market Entry Proposal

Welcome to the BRIGHTSPOT Movie Production roadmap for diving into the film world. Backed by deep data dives we've done, this guide highlights what really makes a movie click with audiences. As a data science consultant for BRIGHTSPOT, we are thrilled to shed light on how you can boost your ROI in the cinematic arena.

## **Key Findings**

### **1. Genres that Shine**
- **Recommendation:** Focus your efforts on *Mystery*, *Horror*, and *Thriller* movie genres. These genres have shown a consistent pattern of delivering high ROI.

### **2. Optimal Movie Length**
- **Recommendation:** Target a runtime of *108-120 minutes* for the best chances of a high ROI. It aligns well with the average audience's attention span and allows for more showings per day in theaters.
- **Exceptions:** 
    - Short films (around 85 mins) often gain traction in film festivals, which can significantly boost their popularity and returns.
    - Movies in genres like Epic Fantasies, Historical Dramas, and Complex Thrillers might require longer runtimes (around 135 mins) to properly narrate the story.

### **3. Budget Sweet Spot**
- **Recommendation:** Invest primarily in movies with budgets in the range of *$5 million to $20 million*.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Consider producing a few lower-budget films (<$5 million). They have the potential to become surprise hits with reduced production risks.

- **Insight:** A weak negative correlation was observed between production budgets and ROI. This indicates that simply increasing the production budget does not guarantee a proportionally higher ROI.

### **4. Characteristics of a Successful Movie**
To optimize for success, aim for movies that meet the following criteria:
- Receive a high number of votes (>1000)
- Attain high ratings (>7.0)
- Achieve an ROI of >10%

## **Strategic Considerations**

- **Genre Influence:** Movies with over 20% ROI typically belong to the Mystery, Horror, and Thriller genres.
  
- **Budgeting Insights:** While higher budgets might enhance production quality, they don't necessarily promise higher returns. A balanced portfolio approach is recommended.

- **Innovation & Marketing:** Innovative filmmaking techniques, combined with viral marketing strategies, can significantly boost a movie's ROI.

## **Areas for Further Research**
While our current findings provide robust recommendations, the ever-evolving nature of the movie industry necessitates continuous research. Here are some areas we believe deserve further attention:
- Update with newer data to remain relevant in this fast-paced industry.
- Explore how streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ influence movie viewership trends and box office returns.
- Understand international markets and how they compare to domestic ones in terms of popularity and revenue.
- Investigate the relationship between marketing budgets and ROI.

We hope that our findings and recommendations offer valuable insights as you consider your entry into the movie market. The key to success is not just producing a great movie but also making informed decisions backed by data. We wish BRIGHTSPOT Movie Production all the best in its endeavors!
